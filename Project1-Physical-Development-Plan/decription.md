# Project Details

TITLE: Bende Physical Development Plan 2019 - 2044
LOCATION: Bende Local Government Area, Abia State, Nigeria
COMMISSIONER: Federal Government, through its Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH) 
CONSULTANT: Messrs. TEE-Ay-Ay Limited (Toyin Ayinde \& Associates)

## Brief Project Description
The physical development plan aims to transform Bende Town from its state of neglect and disorganised growth into a functional and sustainable environment for living, investment, and job creation. This plan is meant to provide a foundation for the physical planning, expansion, and development of Bende Town. The Government of Nigeria, in its efforts to prepare and implement the First National Physical Development Plan (NPDP), offered technical assistance to Abia State by financing the preparation of physical development plans for Bende Town. The project was carried out in three stages. Since no official outline existed, the inception stage included an introductory site visit and boundary delineation. It also involved acquiring aerial imagery. The interim stage featured a baseline assessment, collecting and analysing data on socioeconomic characteristics, existing infrastructure, traffic volume, and community needs. The final stage involved preparing the physical development proposal for 25 years based on earlier findings and consultations with community stakeholder groups.

## My Contribution
As part of the project team, I contributed to all key components of the baseline study, analysis, conceptual design, and technical reporting. I managed the processing of drone-acquired imagery into a georeferenced orthomosaic of Bende town and digitised existing structures using AutoCAD. Additionally, I translated field-collected data on land use and infrastructure into comprehensive baseline maps. I performed a terrain-based analysis to identify potential growth corridors based on elevation patterns and assisted in designing the physical development plan of Bende, synthesising baseline findings with socio-economic data and community needs assessments. Finally, I coordinated the compilation and layout of the project’s inception, interim, and final technical reports, ensuring they aligned with the project’s strategic objectives.
