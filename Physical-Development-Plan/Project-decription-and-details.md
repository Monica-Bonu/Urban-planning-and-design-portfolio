TITLE: Bende Physical Development Plan 2019 - 2044

LOCATION: Bende Local Government Area, Abia State, Nigeria

COMMISSIONER: Federal Government, through its Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH) 

CONSULTANT: Messrs. TEE-Ay-Ay Limited (Toyin Ayinde \& Associates)


## Brief Project Description

The physical development plan aims to transform Bende Town from its state of neglect and disorganised growth into a functional and sustainable environment for living, investment, and job creation. This plan is meant to provide a foundation for the physical planning, expansion, and development of Bende Town. The Government of Nigeria, in its efforts to prepare and implement the First National Physical Development Plan (NPDP), offered technical assistance to Abia State by financing the preparation of physical development plans for Bende Town. The project was carried out in three stages. Since no official outline existed, the inception stage included an introductory site visit and boundary delineation. It also involved acquiring aerial imagery. The interim stage featured a baseline assessment, collecting and analysing data on socioeconomic characteristics, existing infrastructure, traffic volume, and community needs. The final stage involved preparing the physical development proposal for 25 years based on earlier findings and consultations with community stakeholder groups.


## My Contribution

As part of the project team, I contributed to all key components of the baseline study, analysis, conceptual design, and technical reporting. I managed the processing of drone-acquired imagery into a georeferenced orthomosaic of Bende town and digitised existing structures using AutoCAD. Additionally, I translated field-collected data on land use and infrastructure into comprehensive baseline maps. I performed a terrain-based analysis to identify potential growth corridors based on elevation patterns and assisted in designing the physical development plan of Bende, synthesising baseline findings with socio-economic data and community needs assessments. Finally, I coordinated the compilation and layout of the project’s inception, interim, and final technical reports, ensuring they aligned with the project’s strategic objectives.

# Baseline study of Bende Town
Since the implementation of the SDGs in 2015, Nigeria has continued to demonstrate its commitment to achieving the global goals through leadership and ownership of the implementation process. However, evidence from the baseline assessment shows that progress in the SDGs in Bende town is very slow. Lack of efficient infrastructure, including social and physical infrastructure as well as utilities, has hampered both physical and economic growth of the town despite being the headquarters of Bende local government. The results of the analysis (both survey and needs assessments) above show shortcomings in the areas of education, livelihood, transportation, and infrastructure. With the estimated increase in population, it becomes more crucial to address the mentioned challenges in order to set a pace for the sustainable development of Bende town.

# Physical Development Plan 2019-2044
With the projected population growth in Bende by 2040, there will be a need for housing and infrastructure to accommodate both current and future residents. This requires redefining the development boundaries for Bende town by 2044. Insights from elevation analysis guided this boundary adjustment.  The proposed development plan addresses key aspects for the future growth of Bende town, including land use allocation and strategic provision of social and physical infrastructure to support the town's development in line with the SDGS. Specifically, this plan targets five key SDG goals: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Additionally, it includes other proposal not shown on the map above include establishing the Bende committee, comprising local stakeholders, to oversee the realisation of the development plan's objectives and the renovation and improvement of existing infrastructure.
